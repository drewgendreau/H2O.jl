# H2O

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/randyzwitch/H2O.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/randyzwitch/H2O.jl)

This package is in its infancy, as an attempt to create this package using just the H2O REST API and native Julia code as feasible. If you'd like to contribute, leave an issue and we'll make a more formalized plan for development.
